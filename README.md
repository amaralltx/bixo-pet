## Installation Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amaralltx/bixo-pet.git
    cd bixo-pet
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**

    *   Create a MySQL database named `bixopet`.
    *   Import the database schema (you'll need to create the `clientes` and `log_alteracoes` tables, sample SQL structure below based on application usage).

    ```sql
    -- Example table structure (clientes)
    CREATE TABLE clientes (
        id_cliente INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        nome VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        telefone VARCHAR(20),
        email VARCHAR(255),
        nome_pet VARCHAR(255),
        especie VARCHAR(255),
        raca VARCHAR(255),
        ultima_atualizacao TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

    -- Example table structure (log_alteracoes)
    CREATE TABLE log_alteracoes (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        tipo_acao VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
        registro_id INT NOT NULL,
        dados_anteriores TEXT,
        dados_novos TEXT,
        ip_origem VARCHAR(50),
        data TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

3.  **Configure the database connection:**

    *   Edit the `config/config.php` file to match your MySQL database credentials:

    ```php
    <?php
    define('DB_SERVER', 'your_db_server'); // e.g., 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'your_db_username');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_db_password');
    define('DB', 'bixopet');
    ```

4.  **Web Server Configuration:**

    *   Configure your web server (Apache or Nginx) to point to the project's root directory.
    *   Ensure that PHP is properly configured and enabled for your web server.
    *   Make sure the web server has the correct permissions to read and write to the project directory and especially the `php-error.log` file created by `actions.php`.

## Usage Guide
